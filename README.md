# Central-limit-theorem-experiment

This python file contains an experiment about the correctness and performance of the central limit theorem. I took a data set called breast cancer data set from scikit learn data sets in order to test the central limit theorem. However, since this data set is not that much bigger I generated a larger data set by my self so as to better illustrate it performance.
